# Code Switch & BRD Test Master

This repository contains two main projects:

1. **Code Switch (v2.0)** - An intelligent chatbot designed to switch languages based on user input, facilitating seamless conversations in multiple languages.
  
2. **BRD Test Master** - A generative AI tool that automatically generates test cases from Business Requirement Documents (BRD) using a multimodal approach.

Both projects are integrated into a unified Streamlit application for easy navigation and usability.
